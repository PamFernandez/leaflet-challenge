## Process



This assignment was to create a map using Leaflet.js to plot all of the earthquakes from a GeoJson dataset based on their longitude and latitude. 

Additionally, the size of the data marker needed to reflect the magnitude of the earthquake and the color of the data marker needed to reflect the depth at which the earthquake occured. 
The USGS website provides several different data sets to choose from. All the data sets are updated every minute to provide nearly real-time information on earthquakes happening around the globe. I chose the data set that contains all earthquakes from the past seven days.

### For a bonus I added an overlay to my map to show the borders of the tectonic plates - illustrating the relationship between tecctonic plates and seismic activity. I also added a control to the legend to turn the tectonic plate borders on and off.


## Summary
The final product was a web application created with Leaflet.js that included two base layers and two overlayers that could be chosen and turned off and on. 

Each time the application is refreshed it is updated with the current information contained in the geoJSON file hosted on the USGS website.
